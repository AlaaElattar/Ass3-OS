# CPU Scheduling
**Determining which process will own CPU for execution while another process is on hold. The main task of CPU scheduling is to make sure that whenever the CPU remains idle, the OS at least select one of the processes available in the ready queue for execution.** 

**Graphical user intreface showing wait and turnaround time of each process, also a Gantt chart showing the simulated processes.**

## Algorithms
* **Priority Scheduling.**
* **Shortest Job First (SJF).**
* **Shortest Remaining Time First (SRTF).**
* **AGAT**
